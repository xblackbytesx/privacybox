For Anthropic (Claude) support:

https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/3288#issuecomment-2219524566

```
Go to https://openwebui.com/f/justinrahb/anthropic/
Press Get and specify your OpenWebUI URL to install the script into your Workspace as a Function.
Once installed, click the setting icon for that new function (called Valves for some reason) and enter your Anthropic key.
Enjoy Claude working perfectly without an entire new Pipelines docker image needed.
